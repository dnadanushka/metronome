Investigations (scheduling and interface):
  ✔ Logic: Learn how timers/interval scheduling work @logic @done(19-08-10 16:28)
  ✔ Change a number on a timer system @ui @done(19-08-10 16:28)
  ✔ Find audio player library @deps @done(19-08-10 16:28)
  ✔ Play sound in scheduler. @logic @done(19-08-10 16:28)

MVP:
  ☐ Display tempo
  ☐ Allow changing tempo
  ☐ allow changing time signature (ie, change `_bar`)
  ☐ Enable changing selected sounds.

VP / Ideas:
  ☐ Display recent tempos
  ☐ Store last chosen tempo on re-opening application
  ☐ Show animations for each style (3/4, 4/4) - probably just shapes + color + animations 
  ☐ Test working on android
  ☐ Users can set custom sounds.
